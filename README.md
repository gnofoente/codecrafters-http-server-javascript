This is my solution for CodeCrafters' ["Build Your Own HTTP server" challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).
It is an HTTP server that responds to a few basic requests, using **net**, **process** and **fs** libraries. It has a built-in router that uses RegEx to parse simple endpoint paths.
For now, everything is dumped into **main.js**.
